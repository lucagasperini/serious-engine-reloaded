DESCRIPTION:

A strange organism originating from marshy wastelands in the system of Rigil Kentaurus. They live in large groups and have a suicidal instinct for protecting their territory. In all-devastating havoc, all individuals try to leap at the intruder and explode, by over inflating themselves. Upon exploding, toxic slime contained in their intestines splashes the target.

TIPS:

- One of these alone is not dangerous, but a swarm is deadly
- Destroy at range
