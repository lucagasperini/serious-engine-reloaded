WEAPON:    SBC Cannon
AMMO:      HP uranium-filled cannonballs
ROF:       variable

DESCRIPTION:

This is the most powerful infantry weapon available to federation forces. Its firing mechanism and barrel were not designed by human scientists, but reverse-engineered from powerful technomagical weapons used by Mental's artillery. The design of the weapon allows for firing very heavy rounds at high speed to provide for an excellent penetration effect.
Loaded with high piercing uranium-filled cannonballs, it can even drill through several tough opponents in a row.

NOTES:

- Military experts claim that the lead casing used on the cannonballs completely eliminates potential hazards for the operator caused by the uranium filling
- Uranium caused hazards to the target are not held important, considering the purpose of the device
