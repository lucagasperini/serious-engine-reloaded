DESCRIPTION:

This weapon is still in experimental phase, but has so far proved to be very reliable. Four barrels fire in succession, allowing the weapon to deliver slowlight energy pulses with extremely high rate of fire for a long period of time without overheating. 
Made entirely of titanium, it is both very light and immune to usual overheating problems, which makes it an excellent energy weapon.

NOTES:

- Useful for covering large areas and holding enemy masses away
