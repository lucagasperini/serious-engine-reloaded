WEAPON:    MKIII Grenade Launcher
AMMO:      40mm High Explosive rounds
ROF:       variable

DESCRIPTION:

A reliable infantry grenade thrower with adjustable launching speed. MKIII is designed to deliver highly explosive grenades over obstacles and around corners, whilst reducing the chance of the operator being hurt by the projectile. A smart impact detector detonates the grenade on impact with a live target, but not with a wall. 

NOTES:

- Tap the trigger for slow launching or hold it down to deliver at longer ranges
- Wide range explosions are effective against large masses of enemies
- Bounce grenades around corners, or lob them over walls
