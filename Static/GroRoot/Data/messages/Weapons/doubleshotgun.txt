WEAPON:    Double Barrel Coach Gun
AMMO:      12 Gauge shells
ROF:       two shells manual reloading
BARREL:    20"

DESCRIPTION:

Standard double-barreled 12 Gauge shotgun. Efficient for short-range elimination of medium sized enemies, but scatters the pellets too much to be used for long range shooting. 

NOTES:

- Slow due to completely manual reloading
- Inefficient at long range
