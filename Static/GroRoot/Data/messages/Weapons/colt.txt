WEAPON:    Shofield .45 w/ TMAR
AMMO:      .45 Colt
ROF:       single action, manual reloading
MAGAZINE:  6 bullets + TMAR 
WEIGHT:    2 lbs, 5 oz
LENGTH:    12 3/4"

DESCRIPTION:

Replica of original 1875 Shofield cavalry model, modified for increased accuracy. A solid and reliable weapon, but normally not very efficient for combat situations due to its low rate of fire.
This one is fitted with a small Techno-Magical Ammunition Replenisher (TMAR) captured from Mental's forces, to provide infinite ammunition supply. Useful as a last-resort defence and for elimination of weaker enemies at long-range.

NOTES:

- Can be used in combination with NETRICSA's target detection system for accurate long range shooting
