DESCRIPTION:

The success of it's first abomination of nature - the Biomechanoid - pushed Mental even further this time.  In an attempt to create a perfect and obeying bodyguard, Mental decided to combine robotic parts with an even simpler organic creature - an insect larvae.  Larva was heavily armed and put into a 'strength multiplicator' device and was supposed to guard Mental.  Things did not work out as planned.  After the 17th assassination attempt by Larva on Mental and many hours spent teaching the cyborg the difference between it's Master and a common caterpillar, Mental finally gave up and found it's pet a new job: guarding a portal that could bring some serious trouble his way.

TIPS:

- Larva's strength flows from the force...reactors. The creature will recharge its batteries when low on power, so be sure to check out the surrounding area for any suspicious devices
- Use the columns to hide from it's weapons
