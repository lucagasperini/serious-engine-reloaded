DESCRIPTION:

Mental was amazed with the concept of your most powerful weapon and so tried to create something similar. Mental enhanced an ordinary medieval cannon with an auto-loading system, radar and ammunition replenisher, making it a pretty effective and dangerous stand-alone defense unit.  The enhanced version of this device is placed on a rotating base which enables it a full 360 degrees attack.

TIPS:

- Avoid cannonballs by constant movement
