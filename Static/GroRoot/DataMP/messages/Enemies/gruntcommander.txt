DESCRIPTION:

Mental transported these soldiers to the Earth from an unknown part of the universe.  They were once a race of fearsome warriors but as they conquered more planets than they possibly knew what to do with, they decided to slow down for a while. Most of the population took a long overdue vacation on one of the most beautiful tropical planets in their system; but as they only sunbathed from 10A.M. to 4P.M., after a few years most of them had no skin left on their bodies. Only a few of the lucky ones (with bits of skin left), were immediately promoted to Commanders - which generally meant getting a bigger gun, wearing underwear in public, and not leaving bloody stains on everything they touch.

TIPS:

- They sweep the area in front of them with several laser shots
