DESCRIPTION:

One of the most powerful sorcerers that ever lived in the known universe, Mordekai served Mental for over 3000 years.  He served him so well indeed, that Mental missed him very much and resurrected him after he died in a bizzare accident involving the Necronomicon, 20,000 pounds of ectoplasm and a mispronounced Latin proverb.  He was automatically assigned to train Mental's creatures in the art of spellcasting and employing magic for truly 'evilish' purposes. 

P.S. Mental was a little late with the process of resurrection, so Mordekai's brain is slightly damaged; he is often heard to speak complete nonsense, or as one would say, utter crap.  In Latin.

TIPS:

- He can disappear quickly so be sure to introduce him to the modern artillery while he is in corporal state
- His magic powers are very likely to disperse if he is killed; this would also cause the disintegration of his evil minions
