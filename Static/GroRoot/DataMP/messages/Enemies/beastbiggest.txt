DESCRIPTION:

A large four-handed reptile living at Aludran system in the constellation of Canis Major. This primitive race has agreed to fight for Mental in exchange for spell-casting powers.
It casts self-propelled fireballs with primitive homing abilities. 
The Highlander race is significantly larger and more dangerous than the ordinary creatures living in the plains. When furious, Higlanders cast their missiles in very quick succession. Highlander females are even more dangerous, not only because of their enormous size, but also because of the fact that their biological constitution dictates an all-year-round PMS.
