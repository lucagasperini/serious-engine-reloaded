DESCRIPTION:

An ancient Mayan deity, Kukulkán has nothing to do with Mental at all.  In fact he is a good god indeed.  It is believed that Kukulkán controls wind so he is very favored by the Mayans.  However, he is also the guardian of a portal that the Sirians left, and one must say a very serious one!  Kukulkán cannot be destroyed - but he is a fair player - when defeated he will evaporize into thin air and open the portal for the victor as a sign of respect.  He is truly a god in every possible way.

TIPS:

- Avoid twisters or you'll be closer to heaven in no time
- Kukulkán is very resistant to bullets, use explosive weapons instead
