DESCRIPTION:

Mental transported these soldiers to Earth from an unknown part of the universe.  They were once a race of fearsome warriors but as they conquered more planets than they possibly knew what to do with, they decided to slow down for a while.  Most of the population took a long overdue vacation on one of the most beautiful tropical planets in their system; but as they only sunbathed from 10A.M. to 4P.M., after a few years most of them had no skin left on their bodies.

TIPS:

- Try to avoid their fast laser beams
