DESCRIPTION:

Another hideous mutation, courtesy of Notorius Mental. A simple lizard-like organism from Fiendia Prime was crossbred and mutated through several generations, and was finally reinforced with a titanium skeleton. It has a unique ability of forming a miniature black hole through which it can summon floating balls of molten lava into existence. Weak magical forces will hold this fiery projectile coherent for a short period of time. As it flies through the air, it will cool down and finally explode.

TIPS:

- There is no way to destroy the Demon's projectiles... avoid them until they explode
