This is what you get when you introduce the concept of firearms to a creature who's got wisdom teeth problems. Mental trained these brutes in his dreaded 'East Clintwood' institute, which was named after a famous 20th century gun wielding actor.  He used to build discipline by telling them that if they did't work hard, they would end up taking pictures of bridges. They all graduated.
