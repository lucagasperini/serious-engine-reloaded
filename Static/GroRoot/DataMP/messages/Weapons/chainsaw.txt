WEAPON:    'Bonecracker' P-LAH Chainsaw
AMMO:      Fuel from a self-contained micro fusion fuel synthesizer
WEIGTH:    27 lbs

DESCRIPTION:

This familiar weapon only looks like it was made on Earth.  It seems that only it's design and purpose were taken from the concept of the familiar chainsaw design.  Inside the titanium alloy casing you will find a self-contained micro fusion fuel synthesizer that is capable of producing enough fuel for 10000 years of non-stop operation.  Unfortunately, there is only a 6 month guarantee for all the moving parts and they tend to break very soon after that period.  Truly a marvel of modern engineering and economics.


NOTES:

- Don't try to use this baby when you're being attacked by long-ranged opponents
