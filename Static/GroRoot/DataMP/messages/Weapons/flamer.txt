DESCRIPTION:

This experimental weapon uses highly volatile napalm fuel to deliver a jet stream of flesh-penetrating flame.  It is very effective for use on large masses, since the stream will engulf even partially hidden enemies.  The fact that enemies will burn for a few moments after they've been hit makes this weapon even more effective.  One might say that it's a 'FIRE and forget' type of thing.

NOTES:

- Clear large masses of enemies with this weapon
