WEAPON:    RAPTOR 16mm Sniper
AMMO:      16mm AP Sniper Bullets
ROF:       Manual
RANGE:     1400 yds

DESCRIPTION:

The RAPTOR Sniper is one of the most powerful long range weapons in the world.  The 16mm armor piercing kevlar coated bullets will pass right through most known armor types.  It causes instant death to small and mid-sized species.

The Raptor has an automatic excess pressure exhaust mechanism that will lower the exit speed of the bullet when it is not fired from a balanced sniping mode.  This provides maximum safety and minimizes injuries to the weapons wielder. 


NOTES:

- Be sure to use the Raptor in sniping (zoom) mode, since it will deliver much more damage when fired this way

- Using sniper on bigger nasties like Biomechanoids, Lava Elementals,... is much less effective
